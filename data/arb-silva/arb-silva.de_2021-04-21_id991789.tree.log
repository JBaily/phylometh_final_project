Warning, you specified a working directory via "-w"
Keep in mind that RAxML only accepts absolute path names, not relative ones!

RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file


IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment validation warnings have been suppressed. Found 0 duplicate sequence and 978 undetermined columns

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file /bioinf/software/silva-dispatcher/_main/var/tmp/silva-dispatcher/991789.7fec9488da992743f8cc84b4c8e1fe59ff65bd63/arb-silva.de_2021-04-21_id991789_in.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 978 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data



This is RAxML version 8.2.9 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on July 20 2016.
